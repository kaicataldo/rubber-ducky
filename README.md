rubber duck debugging command line utility
```

          / a a\__,
          \  -.___/

 \_   (__       /
   \___________/
```
### usage
```
$ npm install -g rubberducky
$ ducky
```

### interactive mode
`rubberducky` includes an interactive mode for situations where one might not want to speak out loud to the duck. in interactive mode, the duck will ask the following questions:
 * can you explain to me what you want your code to do?
 * and can you go over what your code is actually doing, line by line?

use the `--interactive` flag to begin in interactive mode, or input `interactive` at any time to start it. To exit interactive mode, input `noninteractive`.

### info
*rubber duck debugging* asserts that *solutions to problems oftentimes present themselves when one is forced to verbalize the problem and the steps taken to attempt to solve said problem*. the duck is merely a friendly face for you to talk to, to have to explain to.

in the end, this is not so different from talking out loud to yourself, and in fact, you'd actually be talking to a real person then. so you can try that instead, if you want â€“ just don't be surprised if your co-workers become alarmed or concerned.

speaking to a duck eliminates this unnecessary stress on your peers and will help you articulate more clearly and *without assumed knowledge on the part of the listener* (the aforementioned duck). you're of course free to live your life as you choose, but trust me, *you probably wanna talk to the duck*.
