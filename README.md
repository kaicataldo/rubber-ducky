### Inspiration
Inspired by the concept of rubber duck debugging. If you're unfamiliar with the concept:
 * [Wikipedia's Article on Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
 * [rubberduckdebugging.com](http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/)
 * [This post from Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/)

Intended for those who are working through a tough problem and might not have a rubber duck on hand (or want to be seen speaking to an inanimate object at work!).

### Installation
Install globally to make your rubber duck just a `ducky` command away!
```
$ npm install -g rubber-ducky
$ ducky
```
